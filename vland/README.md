# Vland - NFT Example

Vland is an example project, aimed to analyze differences between [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards.

In particular, as a case of use, we will manage NFTs that represent lands, on which there may be (linked) other NFTs that represent other assets such as buildings, mines, roads, rivers, etc. A user can therefore buy both the ownership of a land, but also of the assets that are connected to it, thus simulating what happens in reality.
